# TechNova - ACSES DKTE 🚀

Welcome to **TechNova**, a technical event organized by the **Association of Computer Science and Engineering Students (ACSES)** at **DKTE**. This repository contains the solutions for all the rounds conducted during the event.

## Event Structure 📚

TechNova consisted of three exciting rounds, each designed to test the participants' proficiency in **C programming** and **web development basics** (HTML & CSS):

### 1. Basics of C - Quiz 📝

In the first round, participants were challenged with multiple-choice questions (MCQs) focused on the fundamentals of C programming.

### 2. Debugging C Programs 🐞

The second round involved identifying and correcting errors in three C programs. Participants were provided with buggy code and had to fix it to produce the correct output.

### 3. Fixing a Broken Website 💻

In the third and final round, participants worked on fixing a broken website using HTML and CSS. They were required to correct the structure and styling to restore the website's functionality and appearance.

Feel free to browse the solutions and use them as learning material. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to raise an issue or get in touch with the organizers.
